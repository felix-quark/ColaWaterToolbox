ArcGIS geoprocessing tools for Columbia Water
*********************************************

.. note::
    This project is under active development.

What is this for?
=================

colawater-toolbox aims to automate difficult or common tasks involved in water-related GIS. 
Complex logic that is uninmplementable or overly intricate using the regular tooling in
ArcGIS Pro is provided here, especially for workflows specific to Columbia Water.
Additionally, some simple workflows have many steps, which means more opportunities for error.
The toolbox also provides streamlined geoprocessing tools for this use case
that not only speed up these already quick tasks, but remove the need to manually engage
with every step of the process.
