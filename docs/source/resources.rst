ArcPy Reference
---------------

ArcPy is the Python library provided by ESRI for interacting with ArcGIS Pro.
The `ArcPy reference <reference_>`_ is their comprehensive documentation explaining 
the public API and providing examples on how to use said API.
Reading through and exploring the reference is a good way to get familiar with the 
library's offerings and to also understand ColaWaterToolbox's own code, which heavily
relies on ArcPy and uses it extensively.

    development that are better suited to its codebase.
    The ArcPy template is just a helpful reference.
